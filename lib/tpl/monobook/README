PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter



I. Using/Installing the template
  Using "monobook" is simple and works just as described at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template>: extract the downloaded archive into
  your DokuWiki's "lib/tpl/" folder. Then select the template in the Config
  Manager by adjusting the template option. Done. :-)

  If you are updating an existing monobook-installation: please have a look at
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>, you should find all needed
  information there.

  NOTE: If everything will be displayed unformatted, your PHP environment is
        probably affected by PHP bug #49692 (see bugreport at
        <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49692> for details). You may find errors
        like "syntax error, unexpected '/' in ../../lib/tpl/monobook/style.ini
        on line XX" in your PHP logs when this is the case. monobook provides
        a workaround for this, simply delete monobook's "style.ini" to trigger
        the template to use it.



II. Customizing the template
  In order to make updates of your installed "monobook" template easy, follow
  these hints for customizing the template:

  - Place your files in "monobook/user"
    The place for *all* userdefined, custom stuff is "monobook/user".
    Reason: this folder will not be touched on updates. Therefore you may delete
    everything except "monobook/user" and copy all new files into "monobook/" to
    update without loosing your changes. Do not forget to empty your browser's
    cache afterwards.

  - Own logo
    If you want to replace the default logo showed in the upper left, simply
    create a "logo.[png|gif|jpg]" in "monobook/user". The template recognizes
    the file automatically and will use it instead of the default logo.
    Do not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own favicon
    If you want to replace the default favicon, simply create a "favicon.ico" in
    "monobook/user". The template recognizes the file automatically and will use
    it instead of the default one. Do not forget to empty your browser's cache
    afterwards. By the way: you might find the following online tool useful:
    <http://tools.dynamicdrive.com/favicon/>.
    Note: "favicon.png" is also possible but not recommended (cause it is not
          supported by most MSIE versions).

  - Own CSS
    To apply additional CSS rules, edit "monobook/user/screen.css" (influences
    normal layout) and/or "monobook/user/print.css" (influences print layout)
    and/or "monobook/user/rtl.css" (influences "right-to-left" languages like
    hebrew). These files will be included automatically (as the last ones for
    the relevant media, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own JavaScript
    To load additional JavaScript, edit "monobook/user/user.js". Do not forget
    to empty your browser's cache afterwards.
    ATTENTION: Do not forget to activate the template option
               "monobook_loaduserjs" (->"Load 'monobook/user/user.js'?") in the
               DokuWiki Config Manager!

  - Own CSS, language specific
    To apply additional CSS rules only for a specific language, edit/create
    "monobook/lang/<your-language>/style.css". This file will be included
    automatically if DokuWiki runs/shows a page in the language of choice (as
    the last one, therefore you are able to overrule existing styles). Do
    not forget to empty your browser's cache afterwards.

  - Own tabs
    To apply own tabs, have a look at "monobook/user/tabs.php". Don't worry:
    you will find some examples how to define the tabs. If you still have
    questions after playing with the examples, search
    <http://dokuwiki.org/template:monobook> and/or the DokuWiki Forum at
    <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the community if you can't get it
    work.
    If "monobook/user/tabs.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Own footer buttons
    To apply own buttons/graphics in the footer (-> these small 80x15 pics),
    have a look at "monobook/user/buttons.php". Don't worry: you will find some
    examples how to define the buttons. If you still have questions after
    playing with the examples, search <http://dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>
    and/or the DokuWiki Forum at <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the
    community if you can't get it work.
    If "monobook/user/buttons.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Own boxes
    To apply own boxes in the left column/sidebar, have a look at
    "monobook/user/boxes.php". Don't worry: you will find some examples how to
    define the boxes. If you still have questions after
    playing with the examples, search <http://dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>
    and/or the DokuWiki Forum at <http://forum.dokuwiki.org> and/or ask the
    community if you can't get it work.
    If "monobook/user/boxes.php" does not exist, simply copy it out of the
    current actual installation archive.

  - Web analytics software (Piwik, Google Analytics etc.)
    Tools like Piwik and Google Analytics normally provide a small code snippet
    ("tag") which you have to include at your website to make everything work.
    If you want to use such software with this template, have a look at
    "monobook/user/tracker.php". This file exists to make it easier for you.
    You don't have to deliberate where you have to copy and paste the code,
    simply do it there.

  - Own Apple Touch Icon
    If you want to replace the default Apple Touch Icon, simply create a
    "apple-touch-icon.png" in "monobook/user". The template recognizes the file
    automatically and will use it instead of the default one. Have a look at
    Apple's developer database if you need more information ("Configuring Web
    Applications" <http://j.mp/sx3NMT>).



III. Some notes about the dirs of this template
  * "monobook/conf"
    Contains some configuration files (do NOT edit them!), especially
    default.php:  default settings, see
                  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:configuration#default_settings>
    metadata.php: configuration metadata, see
                  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:configuration#configuration_metadata>
  * "monobook/lang"
    Language files (subdir names = language code). You may copy the English
    language files and translate them if your language is missing. Simply mail
    me, Andreas Haerter, the translated files and I will include them in the
    next release :-D.
  * "monobook/static"
    Static files (images, CSS, JavaScript). The interesting stuff is located
    in subdirs (as described below).
    - "3rd"
      Static files originally taken from a third party like MediaWiki or
      DokuWiki. The subdir "dokuwiki" contains files originally taken from the
      DokuWiki "default" or "starter" template. The subdir "monobook" contains
      files taken from the MediaWiki "monobook" skin.
    - "css"
      All non-3rd-party Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). See <http://j.mp/eq8zSo>
      for more information about how the CSS is handled.
    - "img"
      All non-3rd-party images files.
    - "js"
      All non-3rd-party JavaScript files.
  * "monobook/user"
    Place for userdefined stuff. E.g. if you want to replace the default-logo,
    simply copy a logo.[png|gif|jpg] in here. See "II. Customizing the template"
    for details.



IV. Other notes
  - Even if it is not required: If you like the template, think about a small
    donation (see <http://andreas-haerter.com/donate/dokuwiki-template-monobook>)
    and/or a link to <http://andreas-haerter.com/projects/dokuwiki-template-monobook>.
    Thanks :-).

  - This template follows the DokuWiki coding style (see
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:coding_style>). If you want to submit any
    patches, please respect its rules (even if you don't like it - I also don't
    love it but this simply does not matter).

  - Feel free to send patches or suggestions via mail (or post on
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>).

  - Please don't delete the "index.html" and ".htaccess" files for security
    reasons, even if you don't know why they are there. These files should
    prevent others from listing directory contents (a built in feature of most
    webservers) and providing additional access protection for some files. Even
    if everything should be secure without, I prefer some additional
    precautions.



V. About
  "monobook" is a template to offer MediaWiki/Wikipedia Look&Feel to DokuWiki.
  It is created by me, Andreas Haerter and heavily inspired and partially based
  on the great "Monobook for DokuWiki" template originally maintained by
  Terence J. Grant (<http://tjgrant.com/>) from 2006 until the end of 2009.
  If you have any suggestions and/or bug reports, feel free to post on
  <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>, send me an email or have a look
  at <http://andreas-haerter.com/contact>.

  After some discussion and a quick release as "monodoku", this template was
  renamed to "monobook" to replace the existing "Monobook for DokuWiki" by
  Terence J. Grant cause Terence got no more time for maintenance (BTW: Terence,
  thank you for your work and your great(!) ideas I got from your "Monobook for
  DokuWiki"). To cut a long story short: you may call this template a
  rewrite/successor of Terence J. Grant's "Monobook for DokuWiki".

  There are some reasons for a complete rewrite (instead of improving/patching
  Terence J. Grant's one), let me explain the initial situation:
    * "monobook" is a wide-spread skin for the MediaWiki-Software. It is also
      used by Wikipedia right now (Jan 2010).
    * Terence J. Grant (<http://tatewake.com/>) created "monobook for DokuWiki".
      He emulated some missing MediaWiki features within the DokuWiki
      environment with his template (e.g.: discussion pages) - he did a great
      job! The styles themselfs are a relatively hard copy of the original
      "monobook" css- and js-files from MediaWiki's "monobook" and the Wikipedia
      website. IMHO Terence had quick updates in mind when doing this (means:
      when Wikipedia is updating its styles, he might just want to copy the
      static stuff, comment out some lines and the "porting" would be done). You
      will find some information about his actions in the README of the replaced
      "monobook for DokuWiki" by Terence J. Grant (still available at
      <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:monobook>).
    * Terence J. Grant does not have enough time for maintenance (as he said on
      his website at the end of 2009). Additionally, the roughly wrapped
      Wikipedia/monobook-styles and the structure were makinging some trouble:
      - The styles were bloated (-> they are not designed for DokuWiki, most
        styles are simply not used plus they are specialized for Wikipedia's
        websites, not even MediaWiki in special).
      - Hardcoded URLs within some css-files were resulting in problems in SSL
        environments (-> loading unencrypted content from
        http://upload.wikimedia.org... additionally, calling third party hosts
        is bad behaviour + LAN-only environments simply will not get needed
        files).
      - The styles.ini was not used, leading to *much* bigger stylesheets and
        much more HTTP requests because some nice DokuWiki features were not
        used and/or "Monobook for DokuWiki" was not compatible to (-> "Compact
        CSS and javascript output").
     * Terence J. Grant's template needed the "Display Wiki Page"-plugin (which
       is/was developed by him, too). Right now, this is simply not needed
       anymore: DokuWiki got a core function named "tpl_include_page()" to do
       this.
   That is why I decided to take the great ideas plus some lines of code of
   Terence J. Grant's "monobook for DokuWiki" to rewrite it, following the
   appreciated DokuWiki template structure guidelines
   (-> <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:templates>).
   The downside of this desicion is, that if Wikipedia updates its styles,
   reverse engineering instead of simple file copying is needed if the new
   rules should be applied. But I think this is not really dramatical cause
   not every pinch of change should be ported (and if Wikipedia would get a
   completely new layout, a new DokuWiki template should be created instead
   of forcing people to decide: a) not using updates or b) using a style the
   might not like). I want an optical, not a technical clone.



VI. Creation transcript
  Some developers may find this interesting. Additionally, I am very oblivious
  :-P.

  - Installed DokuWiki (Release "2009-12-25", "Lemming") + Terence J. Grant's
    "monobook" template for testing purpose.

  - Copied the default template from DokuWiki (Release "2009-12-25", "Lemming")
    as mentioned at <http://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:templates> and renamed the
    copy to "monobook". Afterwards, the following files/dirs where deleted:
    * monobook/images
    * monobook/_admin.css
    * monobook/design.css
    * monobook/footer.html
    * monobook/layout.css
    * monobook/_linkwiz.css
    * monobook/media.css
    * monobook/print.css
    * monobook/rtl.css

  - Created the dirs mentioned in "II. Some notes about the dirs of this
    template".

  - Created "index.html" files in all subdirs of the template to prevent
    directory browsing. Plus "deny from all" .htaccess files in all relevant
    template subdirs containing PHP (this is simply some ADDITIONAL security
    precaution - everything should also be save without these files. But better
    safe than sorry).

  - Configured DokuWiki to use Terence J. Grant's "monobook" template to
    determine which styles/files copied from the MediaWiki monobook and/or
    Wikipedia are really in use (after looking and understanding the template
    itself, for sure).
    The interessting folders (as mentioned in the README by Terence J. Grant):
    * common is from mediawiki
    * monobook is from mediawiki
    * wikipedia is from wikipedia
    After this, I looked at "monobook/lang/*" and "monobook/conf*" (from
    Terence J. Grant's "monobook") to take some ideas.

  - After investigation, some files were copied into the provided places within
    "/monobook/static/3rd".
    - The following 3rd-party styles and files were used/are needed for further
      development and therefore were copied from Terence J. Grant's "monobook"
      template:
      * /monobook/monobook/buttonshadow.png
      * /monobook/monobook/bullet.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/discussionitem_icon.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/external.png
      * /monobook/monobook/file_icon.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/headbg.jpg
      * /monobook/monobook/IE50Fixes.css
      * /monobook/monobook/IE55Fixes.css
      * /monobook/monobook/IE60Fixes.css
      * /monobook/monobook/IE70Fixes.css
      * /monobook/monobook/IEMacFixes.css
      * /monobook/monobook/lock_icon.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/mail_icon.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/main.css
      * /monobook/monobook/news_icon.gif
      * /monobook/monobook/rtl.css
      * /monobook/monobook/user.gif
    - The following files were copied from Andreas Gohr's "default" template:
      * /default/*.css (see <http://j.mp/eq8zSo> why I did that)
      * /default/images/closed.gif
      * /default/images/favicon.ico
      * /default/images/link_icon.gif
      * /default/images/mail_icon.gif
      * /default/images/open.gif
      * /default/images/tocdot2.gif
      * /default/images/windows.gif
    - The following files were downloaded from Wikipedia
      * http://de.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/IEFixes.js
      * http://de.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/commonPrint.css

  - Edited "monobook/static/3rd/monobook/main.css"
    - All url() rules were edited (-> "static/3rd/...").
    - "#catlinks" was replaced with ".catlinks" cause the styles are needed for
      more than one element.
    To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files.

  - Edited "monobook/static/3rd/dokuwiki/design.css"
    All url() rules were edited (-> replaced "url(images/" through
    "url(static/3rd/dokuwiki/").
    To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files:
    /* ATTENTION: This file was edited for the "monobook template for DokuWiki".
                  - All url() rules where changed.
                   See README for details. */

  - Edited "monobook/static/3rd/monobook/IE60Fixes.css"
    - "#catlinks" was replaced with ".catlinks" cause the styles are needed for
      more than one element.
    To make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files.

  - Created
    * "monobook/static/css/print.css"
    * "monobook/static/css/rtl.css"
    * "monobook/static/css/screen.css"
    All relevant information should be found within the inline comments.

  - Created the "main.php" for "monobook". Used the main.php of the "default"
    template as base (as mentioned on the DokuWiki template developer sites),
    and doing some cherry picking on the Terence J. Grant's "monobook" main.php.
    After few hours and some coffees later, work was done.

  - Placed the obligatory 80x15 buttons in "/static/img". I copied them
    from the "default" DokuWiki template (exept "button-monobook.png", for
    sure). Added the needed markup in the "main.php".

  - Took Andreas Gohr's original "mediamanager.php" and "detail.php" out of the
    "default" template. After working a little bit, I found a way to prevent
    additional work and/or redundant code to realize the output of these files.
    Everything is described through the PHP comments in the files... look at
    them if needed. I mainly choose the same way like Terence J. Grant.

  - Copied the "do_cite.php" from Terence J. Grant's "monobook", renamed it to
    "inc_cite.php", and edited everything until it was useful for my template.

  - Worked worked worked.... and done! :-P

  - After ~1 year, I switched the CSS base from DokuWiki's default template
    to <http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:starter>. See
    <http://www.freelists.org/post/dokuwiki/Core-devs-I-need-some-info-to-keep-my-templates-maintainable>
    for more information about this. I edited some files, see 
    "monobook/static/3rd/dokuwiki/00_starter-tmpl-notes.txt" for details.
