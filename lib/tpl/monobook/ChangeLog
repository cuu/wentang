2011-03-16  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Switched CSS base from switch css base from 'default' to 'starter' template.
    See <http://j.mp/f7V4ES> and <http://j.mp/eq8zSo> for background
    information.

  * DokuWiki 2010-11-07 compatibility fixes and smaller improvements.

  * Added Slovak language files
    Thanks to Martin Hanula :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * This will be the last manual changelog update.
    We are living in times of useful OSS development platforms. Have a look at
    <https://github.com/andreashaerter/dokuwiki-template-monobook/> if you want
    to know what changed.


2010-08-17  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Added /user/tracker.php to make web analytics software integration easier
    See README for details.

  * Fixed bug: Pull down menus/pickers are invisible (editor toolbar)
    If editing any page, the pull down menu of "Select Headline", "Smileys" and
    "Special Chars" buttons didn't show up cause of an z-index issue. This is
    fixed now.


2010-08-16  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Changed list styles (<ul>, <ol> -> list-style-image and indentation/margin)
    They are finally looking like the ones of the MediaWiki vector. If you want
    the previous indentation back, put the following into your /user/screen.css:
      div#content .dokuwiki ul {
        margin: 0 0 0.8em 3.5em !important;
      }

  * CSS-fix: Wrong font-site for <code> and <pre> @ insitu-footnotes

  * Changed Table of contents (TOC) styles
    Now it looks as usual (compared with the default tamplate)


2010-06-29  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Small IE6 compatibility fixes.


2010-06-28  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * New config option: closed wiki
    If active, most tabs/boxes will be hidden until user is logged in.

  * Template respects $conf['disableactions']
    Links to disabled functions should be hidden now.

  * Completely changed the way CSS was handled
    See <http://j.mp/eq8zSo> why I am do this.

  * Better/new implementation of Andreas Gohr's "translation" plugin integration
    Translations are now linked within the sidebar. The language name will be
    taken from the title attribute (-> introduced in newer plugin versions), so
    you may have to update the plugin. See
    <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:translation> to get the newest version.

  * MANY minor improvements


2010-06-26  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * New config option: user pages
    You can (de)activate user pages now + choose a custom namespace for them.

  * Support for PNG favicons
    I do NOT recommend PNG for favicons (cause it is not supported by
    all browsers), but some users requested this feature. See README for
    details.

  * I replaced all "wl(getID())" with "wl(cleanID(getID())".
    Additionally, all "auth_quickaclcheck(trim($id, ":))" where replaced with
    "auth_quickaclcheck(cleanID($id))". See comment on
    <http://bugs.splitbrain.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=1983> for details.


2010-06-05  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Some PHP DocBlock Updates

  * Minor CSS improvements


2010-06-02 Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Added workaround for the "Jumping textarea" MSIE8 bug

  * Added Spanish language files
    Thanks to Jacobo María Pantoja Checa :-) (see CREDITS for details).


2010-05-30  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Fixed wrong array keys in "/lang/it/settings.php"


2010-05-29  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Added Dutch language files
    Thanks to Theo Klein :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Added Brazilian Portuguese language files
    Thanks to Sérgio Evandro Motta :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Addes some more examples to /user/boxes.php


2010-05-28  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Configurable: Table of contents
    You are now be able to choose: show the TOC placed at the left column or
    embedded within the article (which is the default/normal behavior). See the
    config option "monobook_toc_position" for details.
    Thanks to Kai Raven <http://blog.kairaven.de/> for this suggestion.

  * Removed "access denied" messages for included pages
    If a client is not able to access an included wikipage, an "access denied"
    message was shown instead of the rendered page content. Many users were
    wishing another behaviour at least for the navigation - I will follow them
    and therefore simply nothing will be shown now if an included page is not
    accessible.

  * Added link to recent changes link to the default toolbox.

  * "/static/css/screen.css": changed the background color for <file> tags form
    __background_alt__ to __background_other__. the get the old color back,
    insert the following into "/user/screen.css":
    div.dokuwiki pre.file {
      background-color: #dee7ec;
    }
    div.dokuwiki dl.file dt {
      background-color: #dee7ec;
      border-bottom: 1px solid #dee7ec;
    }

  * Removed rev="nofollow" for backlinks-link in default toolbox

  * Fixed wrong path of toolbar button background in "/static/css/screen.css"

  * Some minor improvements + fixed reported bugs

  * Renamed "/static/3rd/style.css" into "/static/3rd/index.html"
    Argh. I created these "index.html" files in all subdirs of the template to
    prevent directory browsing on misconfigured webservers but did not noticed
    this file naming error until today. :-/ If you upgrade, you may delete
    "/static/3rd/style.css" (to be on the safe side: check if the file contains
    HTML instead of CSS. If yes, it is the correct one to delete.). But this is
    just a cosmetic action, so if you do not know what I am talking about here,
    just do not touch anything. ;-)


2010-01-22  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Fixed "id"-Bug in _monobook_renderBoxes()

  * Addes some more examples to /user/tabs.php and /user/boxes.php


2010-01-21  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Small updates to /user/tabs.php

  * Removed quotes from style.ini
    Some environments seem to have trouble with INI-entries like
    > foobar="screen"
    Replaced them trough entries like
    > foobar=screen


2010-01-20  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Added Norwegian language files
    Thanks to Henrik Karlstrøm :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Updated Japanese language files (fixed errors)
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Added "/bug49642.php"
    This file provides a workaround for PHP bug #49642. For details, see the
    bugreport at <http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49692>. If you see errors like
    "syntax error, unexpected '/' in ../../lib/tpl/monobook/style.ini on line
    XX" in your logs, simply delete monobook's style.ini to trigger the usage
    of the workaround. Thanks to Marc and virk for reporting this.


2010-01-19  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Updated French language files (fixed errors)
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Updated Japanese language files
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Fixed some typos, minor improvements


2010-01-17  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Added box examples in /user/boxes.php

  * Updated README regarding the usage of user defined boxes for the left column

  * Added comments in all .htaccess files (regarding file security)
    Commented the files to make sure that these additional Apache rules are not
    necessary to use monobook in a safe way. Additionally, some rules were
    updated to match newly created files in the /user directory.


2010-01-16  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Created /user/boxes.php, /conf/boxes.php
    Left-column boxes are now configurable. See README for details.

  * Added new option $conf["monobook_mediamanager_embedded"]
    If enabled (=default), the mediamanager will be shown in the content area
    like a normal article (including navigation and stuff). If disabled, tabs,
    navigation and footer will be hidden to get a non-embedded, full-width
    media manager like it is known by the default DokuWiki template.

  * Added Japanese language files
    Thanks to Yoshitaka Kunikane :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Updated French language files
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Created /VERSION
    Text file to make it easier for users to determine which version of the
    monobook-template is installed. Updated /.htaccess rules to protect the
    file.

  * Fixed some IE only CSS-issues (no selected tabs, no icons in admin area)
    Thanks to Casper for reporting the bugs.

  * Added DokuWiki environment check in several files (e.g. language files)


2010-01-13  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Created /user/tabs.php
    Own tabs should be defined at /user/tabs.php from now on to make updates
    easy going. See README for details.

  * Created /user/buttons.php, /conf/buttons.php
    Footer buttons/links are now configurable. See README for details.

  * Added Italian language files
    Thanks to Luigi Micco :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * Removed second call of html_msgarea()
    Some people where confused when messages are showed both on top and bottom
    of the page. Thanks to Luis Machuca <gulix.cl> for reporting this.

  * Added "Export PDF" tab for the html2pdf plugin
    Thanks to Luigi Micco for submitting this (see the following for plugin
    info: <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:html2pdf>).

  * Optional site notice was rendered outside the main content divs
    Therefore needed CSS classes were not applied to the rendered content of
    the class. Solution: moved deeper into the XHTML structure, inside
    <div id="bodyContent"><div class="dokuwiki">. Thanks to Luigi Micco for
    reporting this bug.

  * Added some CSS to mark missing "edit summary" input in the admin menu

  * Removed PHP code for Terence J. Grant's Google Analytics for DokuWiki
    The main.php took care about Terence J. Grant's Google Analytics for
    DokuWiki (see <http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:googleanalytics>), but I saw
    today, that this is simply not needed anymore (-> quote 2009-05-25: "Plugin
    is now an action plugin that requires no additional PHP code modification.
    Thanks to Mikhail I. Izmestev for this fix.)


2010-01-12  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Using wl() instead of DOKU_BASE/DOKU_SCRIPT for link creation

  * Added French language files
    Thanks to Tamara Göbes :-) (see CREDITS for details).


2010-01-11  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Renamed the template from "monodoku" to "monobook"
    Michael (known as "chimeric", <chimeric.de>) contacted me on 2010-01-10
    because he talked to Terence J. Grant <http://tjgrant.com/> to maintain
    the template in the future (Terence does not have enough time to do this any
    longer). After some investigation, he though about a rewrite... something I
    already done with the release of "monodoku" ;-). After talking a bit, we
    decided it is the best way to rename "monodoku" into "monobook" and provide
    an upgrade path for the people who are using the no-longer-maintained
    "Monobook for DokuWiki" by Terence J. Grant to get the things working
    smoothly.

  * Rewriting CSS rules
    All new DokuWiki features are supported right now (e.g Link Wizard,
    downloadable code blocks...).

  * Fixed permanent link issue


2010-01-09  Andreas Haerter <development [ät] andreas-haerter.com>
  * Initial release.
