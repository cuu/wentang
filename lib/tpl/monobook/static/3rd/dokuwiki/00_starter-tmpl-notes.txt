II) Modifications
  - I edited _fileuploader.css, _links.css, _media_fullscreen.css, _toc.css:
    All url(images/[...]) rules were changed (-> "static/3rd/dokuwiki/"). To
    make this clear, a comment was added at the top of the files.
  - "static/3rd/dokuwiki/bullet|close|open.gif" were re-saved as PNG.

_fileuploader
III) Notes
  The css files were taken from the "starter template". See the following for
